❓ About
------------
Xypher is an open source, fully customizable Discord Bot. Xypher was designed to work on study servers and its main function is to help teachers to perform complex tasks in a simplified way. An example of this is the function of counting how many people are present in a channel by just using a simple command instead of counting one by one. 
Xypher comes packaged with a variety of commands and it's still growing up.
